# TradingPlatform

Trading Platform (TP) is a software platform designed to run and implement trading environments, involving autonomous desicion-making agents in a real-time simulation envoronment. It is implemented in Java and intended to be run in the IDE of your choice. Its primary purpose is to serve as a research environment for game theoretical experiments.

Presently, TP provides a robust array of low-level trading scenarios in which user-programmed agents can submit trades or make decisions. These can be combined to run both in sequence and concurrently with an arbitrary number of other trading scenarios, that autonomous agents may participate in both simultaneously and sequentially. At is core, it is also designed to be flexible, so that trading environments can be easily modified and adjusted, and so that new environments can be easily and cleanly developed and deployed. Users may vary in their involvement- they may be interested in using agents and trading environments that have already been developed, or may develop agents and environments of their own. A major goal of the platform is to provide useful abstractions of the technical challenges facing researchers in algorithmic game theory seeking to develop clean research environments for the study of trading scenarios. To our knowledge, no similar platform exists.
